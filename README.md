## Object Oriented Programming
1. Type of programming that breaks things into objects that interacts with each other.
2. Objects are created from classes.
3. Object Oriented Programming encourages code reuse through D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself) concept.

### Object
* An Object can be an entity ar anything in your program like a name.
* Examples of real world objects includes things around us like - Houses, cars, bank accounts, pets etc.

### Class
* A class is a blueprint (template) for creating objects.
* Classes can have properties (attributes) which are like variables that store data.
* Classes can also have behaviours (methods). These are like functions.
* You can create many unique objects from a single class.

## Creating a Class
* Create with the keyword class followed by a name.
* Common practice is to make the names Pascal Casing: Example: MyFirstCar
* A class consists of variables (Attributes) and functions (Methods)
* Classes can be used to model a lot of things.
